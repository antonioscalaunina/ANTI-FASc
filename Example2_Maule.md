# EXAMPLE 2 Maule earthquake

The second example will generate slip distributions based on the location and magnitude of the M8.8 Maule earthquake occurred on the south-american slab on the 2010-02-27. Our suggestion is to run this example after the first one presented in the file Example1_Tohoku.md, since most steps are better detailed in that previous example.

In this example the mesh generation is skipped and the precomputed mesh and input baryceneter files are used. 
The procedure is very similar to the previous example and you only need to change some of the settings in the *config_files/Parameters/input.json* file.
From the available files on this repository you can simply change the "main" input file as follow:

    cd config_files/Parameters
    cp input_Maule.json input.json
    
The new *input.json* file will appear as (check the meaning of the parameters in the example 1:

    {"zone_name": "southamerica",
        "Merc_zone": 18,
    "acronym": "SoA",
        "mesh_gen": 0,
    "slab_file": "[]",
    "seismog_depth": 60,
    "depth_interpolator": "nearest",
    "mesh_convex": 0.3,
    "element_size": 12.5e3,

    "Event": {
    "Name": "Maule",
    "Hypo_LonLat" : [-72.71, -35.85],
    "Magnitude" : 8.8
    },
    "Configure": {
    "application": "PTF",
    "shape": "Rectangle",
    "numb_stoch": 5,
    "variable_mu": 1,
    ...............................................
    
From now on the step will be fully similar to the "Tohoku" example

#  1 - Preprocess

Enter in the preprocess folder

    cd preprocess

and run from MATLAB command window the script create_mesh_file.m

Of course, also in this case, you can run it from terminal typing:

    matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop -r "run('create_mesh_file.m'); exit;"

or (if you have installed the MATLAB runtime)

    ./run_create_mesh_file.sh /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime/v99/
    
The Slab 2.0 files (*sam_slab2_dep_02.23.18.xyz* or *sam_slab2_dep_02.23.18.grd*) are also included in the folder *utils/sz_slabs*. Nevertheless, they won't be used. In the folder *utils/sz_slabs/* a database of precomputed mesh is available. In particular this example makes use the southamerica folder

 !!!VERY IMPORTANT: This mesh is very huge and hence the computation of selected barycenter might be very long. This selection is already computed and stored in the file *config_files/Barycenters/ind_aux_full_SoA.mat*. Hence you can skip this part and go directly to step 3. In this case some of the file generated by the *create_mesh* must be moved typing

     cd barycenter_selection
     cp ETo*.mat  ../../config_files/Connection_cell/
     cp *mesh*.inp ../../config_files/Mesh/
     cp *matrix_distance.bin ../../config_files/Matrix_distances/
     
 However, if you want to test also this part follow the instructions below... and be patient!

    
    cd barycenter_selection/

And then:

    matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop -r "run('ind_baryc_pre.m'); exit;"
    
or:

    ./run_ind_baryc_pre.sh /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime/v99/




    
# 3 - Rupture areas and slip distributions

Now, to run the rupture areas computation

    mv ../../bin
    
And execute the script *Rupture_areas_OF.m*

With also the usual two possibilities:

    matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop -r "run('Rupture_areas_OF.m'); exit;"
    
or:

    ./run_Rupture_areas_OF.sh /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime/v99/
    
The slip distributions are computed through the code k223d

    cd ../src/k223d/
    make clean
    make
    mv k223d.x ../../bin
    cd ../..
    ./src/bash_scripts/run_homo.sh    # To compute slip distributions with uniform rigidity
    ./src/bash_scripts/run_var.sh     # To compute slip distributions with variable rigidity
    
    
# 4 - Postprocessing

Finally as already described in the Example 1 - Tohoku, you can obtain the plots of the slip distributions through the script *utils/slip_distribution_plot_AGI.m* 

    matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop -r "run('slip_distribution_plot_AGI.m'); exit;" 

or:

    ./run_slip_distribution_plot_AGI.sh /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime/v99/
