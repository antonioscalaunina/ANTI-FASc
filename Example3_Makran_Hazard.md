# EXAMPLE 3 Tohoku earthquake

In this guided example, we described a different application. Given a mesh, we define an ensemble of slip distributions which represent an almost homogeneous 
coverage of the whole seismogenic area. In this view, the ensemble can be used for the Probablistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment, or as a precmputed ensemble to
extract the needed scenario for PTF application (see Basili et al. 2021 and Selva et al. 2021 [bibliography here](https://github.com/antonioscalaunina/ANTI-FASc/blob/main/README.md)
